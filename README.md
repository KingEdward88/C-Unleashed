# Source code from the book "C Unleashed"

"C Unleashed" was written by Richard Heathfield, Lawrence Kirby and several
other collaborators and published by SAMS in 2000. It's a really good book with
lots of high-quality C code for various programming tasks.

This code is presented as-is, along with its original license (GPL as mentioned

Hope others find this useful!
